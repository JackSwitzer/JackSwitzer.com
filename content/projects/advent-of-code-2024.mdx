# Advent of Code 2024

Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge featuring 25 days of algorithmic puzzles. For 2024, I challenged myself to solve problems across multiple programming languages.

## The Challenge

**8 Languages, 29 Stars**

Rather than optimizing for completion in a single language, I used this as an opportunity to:
- Practice different programming paradigms
- Compare language strengths for different problem types
- Strengthen polyglot programming skills

## Languages Used

1. **Python** - Rapid prototyping and string manipulation
2. **Rust** - Performance-critical solutions
3. **Go** - Concurrent problem solving
4. **Java** - Object-oriented approaches
5. **C** - Low-level optimization
6. **OCaml** - Functional programming patterns
7. **R** - Data manipulation challenges
8. And more...

## Problem Types Encountered

- Graph traversal and pathfinding
- Dynamic programming
- Parsing and string manipulation
- Simulation and state machines
- Mathematical puzzles
- Grid-based algorithms

## Takeaways

This polyglot approach revealed how different languages excel at different problems - OCaml's pattern matching for parsing, Rust's ownership model for memory-intensive problems, Python's expressiveness for quick prototypes.
