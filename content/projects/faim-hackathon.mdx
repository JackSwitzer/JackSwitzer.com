# McGill FAIM Hackathon - Portfolio Optimization

A comprehensive quantitative trading strategy developed for the McGill Finance and Investment Management (FAIM) hackathon.

## Team & Leadership

Led a team of 5 in developing and implementing the trading strategy, coordinating across:
- Data engineering
- Model development
- Portfolio management
- Performance analysis

## Technical Approach

### Stock Prediction Models
- **Elastic Net Regression**: For feature selection and prediction
- **LSTM Neural Networks**: For capturing temporal patterns in price movements
- Trained on **147 investment factors** alongside seasonal data

### High-Performance Computing
Leveraged Queen's University compute cluster for:
- Multi-GPU training optimization
- Large-scale backtesting
- Parallel hyperparameter search

### Portfolio Management
Implemented **Black-Litterman portfolio management**:
- Managed 50-100 stocks in long and short positions
- Combined quantitative signals with market equilibrium
- Dynamic rebalancing based on model predictions

## Results

Achieved an **alpha of 0.00137**, demonstrating positive risk-adjusted returns above market benchmark.
