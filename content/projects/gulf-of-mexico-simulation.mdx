# Gulf of Mexico Trash Collection Simulation

This project addresses the real-world problem of marine pollution in the Gulf of Mexico through computational simulation and optimization techniques. Built as part of APSC 200 at Queen's University.

## Problem Statement

The Gulf of Mexico faces significant trash accumulation challenges. This project models optimal strategies for deploying garbage collection drones to efficiently clean the affected areas.

## Technical Approach

### Multi-Agent System
Developed a Multi-Agent System (MAS) that simulates multiple autonomous drones working together to collect garbage. Each agent makes independent decisions while coordinating with others for optimal coverage.

### Gulf Stream Simulation
Used satellite imagery data to accurately simulate the Gulf Stream current patterns. This allows the model to predict how garbage flows and accumulates over time through a dynamic density map.

### K-Means Clustering
Implemented K-Means clustering to identify optimal drone deployment locations and garbage collection hotspots. This approach led to a **20% efficiency improvement** over existing methodology.

## Results

The simulation demonstrated significant improvements in collection efficiency by:
- Predicting garbage accumulation patterns
- Optimizing drone patrol routes
- Coordinating multi-agent collection efforts
- Adapting to dynamic environmental conditions

## Team

Led a team of 4 engineers through the design, implementation, and testing phases of this semester-long project.
