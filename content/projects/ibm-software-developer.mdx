# IBM Software Developer - Mainframe Modernization

A 12-month internship at IBM (May 2025 - April 2026) focused on modernizing legacy mainframe systems using cutting-edge AI and developer tooling.

## The Challenge

Mainframe systems running COBOL, PL1, and REXX power critical infrastructure across financial services, healthcare, and government. These systems process:
- 95% of ATM transactions
- 80% of in-person transactions
- Trillions of dollars daily in financial transactions

However, the workforce maintaining these systems is aging, and modern developers need tools to understand and modernize this critical code.

## My Contributions

### Benchmark Pipeline Development
Developed the inference portion of a new benchmark pipeline that directly influenced product model decisions. This work helped evaluate and select the best approaches for code translation and explanation tasks.

### VSCode Extension for Code Explanations
Orchestrated a new VSCode extension that provides high-quality code explanations with architecture schema visualization. This tool helps developers understand complex mainframe code without deep legacy expertise.

### MCP & Subagent Tooling
Built Model Context Protocol (MCP) and subagent tooling to enable sophisticated AI-powered code analysis workflows. This infrastructure supports complex multi-step reasoning about legacy codebases.

### Data Dictionary Feature
Delivered the first official feature that adds a comprehensive data dictionary of all variables into the main explain pipeline. This helps other teams quickly understand the functionality and data flow of legacy systems.

### A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Support
Currently working on adding Agent-to-Agent support with improved intricate subagent loops, enabling more sophisticated automated code analysis and transformation workflows.

## Technologies

- **Legacy Languages**: COBOL, PL1, REXX
- **Modern Languages**: Python, Java
- **AI/ML**: LLM integration, AI Agents, MCP protocol
- **Developer Tools**: VSCode Extensions, API development

## Impact

This work directly contributes to IBM's mainframe modernization strategy, helping enterprises maintain and evolve their critical systems while enabling the next generation of developers to work with legacy code effectively.
