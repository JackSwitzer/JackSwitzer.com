# Linear Algebra Course Website

A comprehensive educational website built to support APSC 174 Linear Algebra students at Queen's University. Currently live at [apsc174.jackswitzer.com](https://apsc174.jackswitzer.com).

## Purpose

As a Teaching Assistant for Linear Algebra I, I created this website to:
- Provide students with accessible course materials
- Supplement in-class tutorials with online resources
- Create a centralized hub for all course content

## Features

### Interactive Content
- **Tutorial Notes**: Detailed explanations for each week's topics
- **Embedded Videos**: Visual explanations of key concepts
- **Practice Problems**: Weekly problem sets with solutions

### Math Rendering
Full LaTeX support using KaTeX for beautiful mathematical notation:
- Matrices and vectors
- Equations and proofs
- Complex mathematical expressions

### Modern Web Stack
- **Next.js 14**: React framework for fast, SEO-friendly pages
- **MDX**: Markdown with React components for rich content
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Clean, responsive design

## Impact

The website serves 60+ students weekly, providing:
- 24/7 access to course materials
- Consistent, searchable reference content
- Positive feedback reflected in student performance
