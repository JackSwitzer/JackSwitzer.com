# Handwritten Digit Recognition

A computer vision project exploring Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) for the classic MNIST handwritten digit recognition task.

## The MNIST Challenge

MNIST is a benchmark dataset of 70,000 handwritten digits (0-9). While considered "solved" by modern standards, it remains an excellent testbed for exploring new neural network architectures.

## Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs)

Rather than using traditional MLPs or CNNs, this project implements a **Kolmogorov Arnold Network** - a novel architecture based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem.

### How KANs Differ

- **Traditional Neural Networks**: Fixed activation functions, learnable weights
- **KANs**: Learnable activation functions on edges, no linear weights

This approach can be more interpretable and sometimes more parameter-efficient than traditional architectures.

## Results

Achieved **97.73% test accuracy** on MNIST, demonstrating that KANs can effectively learn visual patterns for digit classification.

## Technical Implementation

- Built in Python using neural network frameworks
- Trained on standard MNIST train/test split
- Explored different KAN configurations and depths
- Compared performance to traditional MLP baselines
