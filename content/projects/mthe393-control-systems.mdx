# Autonomous Ship Stabilization - Black Box System Identification

Course project for MTHE393 at Queen's University. Given an unknown "black-box" dynamical system, the objective was to reverse-engineer its transfer function and design a controller meeting strict performance targets.

**Grade: A+ | Role: Primary technical contributor**

## Problem Context

Ships experience roll motion in rough waters, causing passenger discomfort, cargo instability, and increased fuel consumption. The goal was to design an autonomous stabilization system using fin stabilizer actuation controlled by gyroscopic roll angle sensors.

## System Architecture

The control system uses a feedback loop with PID control and feedforward gain compensation to stabilize roll angle.

## Technical Approach

### 1. LTI System Validation

Before attempting identification, rigorously validated the black-box was Linear Time-Invariant:

- **Homogeneity**: Verified H(2x(t)) = 2H(x(t)) with 0.9997 correlation
- **Superposition**: Verified H(x₁+x₂) = H(x₁) + H(x₂) with 0.9998 correlation
- **Time-Invariance**: Confirmed identical responses under time shifts (RMSE = 0.0000)

### 2. Signal Processing & Noise Removal

The black-box produced extremely noisy outputs requiring sophisticated denoising:

- Evaluated low-pass, high-pass, Gaussian, Chebyshev, and moving-average filters
- Final approach: Pointwise averaging of 20-100 signals per frequency
- Statistical analysis confirmed zero-mean Gaussian noise (μ ≈ 0.0015)

### 3. Bode Plot Construction & Transfer Function Derivation

Systematic frequency response characterization across 10⁻³ to 10⁴ Hz:

- Averaged 20 signals over 50 trials per frequency point
- Used 6 periods per signal to ensure steady-state response
- Derived transfer function coefficients through RMSE optimization

### 4. Controller Design & Results

Designed PID controller with feedforward compensation (L=4010) to move RHP zeros to LHP for stability:

| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Rise Time | 1 s | 0.328 s |
| Overshoot | 1.9 | 1.005 |
| Settling Time | 3 s | 0.58-1.37 s |
| Steady State Error | ±0.05 | 0.002 |

All performance specifications exceeded with significant margins.
