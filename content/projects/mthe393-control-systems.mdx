# MTHE393 Control Systems - Black Box Identification

Course project for MTHE393 at Queen's University focused on system identification and control system design.

## Project Overview

Given unknown "black box" dynamic systems, the goal was to:
1. Identify the transfer function through experimental methods
2. Design a stable control system
3. Implement and tune PID controllers for optimal performance

## Technical Approach

### System Identification
- Applied step response and frequency response methods to characterize unknown systems
- Used MATLAB to fit experimental data to transfer function models
- Validated models against actual system behavior

### Controller Design
- Designed PID controllers based on identified system dynamics
- Used root locus and Bode plot techniques for controller tuning
- Optimized for transient response characteristics (overshoot, settling time)

### Implementation
- Built simulations in Simulink to verify controller performance
- Compared theoretical predictions with experimental results

## Technologies

- **MATLAB**: Numerical analysis and system modeling
- **Simulink**: Block diagram simulation
- **Control Toolbox**: Transfer function analysis and controller design
