# NYT Games Solver

Automated puzzle solvers for New York Times word games, turning daily puzzles into algorithmic challenges.

## Supported Games

### LetterBoxed
A puzzle where you connect letters on a square to form words, with each word starting where the last one ended.

The solver:
- Finds optimal solutions minimizing total words used
- Explores valid word chains connecting all letters
- Uses efficient graph traversal algorithms

### Spelling Bee
Create words using 7 letters, with one center letter required in every word.

The solver:
- Identifies all valid words from the dictionary
- Highlights pangrams (words using all 7 letters)
- Ranks words by point value

## Technical Implementation

### Dictionary Data Structures
Implemented efficient word lookup using:
- Trie structures for prefix matching
- Hash sets for O(1) word validation
- Pre-computed valid word lists

### Search Algorithms
- Depth-first search for LetterBoxed chains
- Constraint satisfaction for valid word generation
- Pruning strategies for performance optimization

## Why Build This?

Beyond solving daily puzzles, this project explores:
- Combinatorial optimization
- Word graph algorithms
- Efficient search strategies
