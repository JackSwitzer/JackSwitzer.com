# Panokeet

Panokeet is an iOS application that acts as a "parakeet" - repeating what you say with intelligent voice-to-text processing and local fine-tuning capabilities.

## Concept

The name "Panokeet" plays on "parakeet" - a bird known for mimicking speech. The app listens to voice input and processes it with intent recognition, learning from user patterns over time.

## Technical Implementation

### Swift & iOS
Built natively for iOS using Swift, ensuring:
- Smooth performance
- Native iOS integration
- Privacy-focused local processing

### Local Machine Learning
Implements local fine-tuning on voice-to-text intent:
- No cloud dependency for core functionality
- User data stays on device
- Personalized recognition improves over time

### Speech Recognition
Leverages iOS speech recognition APIs with custom processing layers for intent detection.

## Status

Currently in active development, focusing on improving recognition accuracy and expanding intent categories.
