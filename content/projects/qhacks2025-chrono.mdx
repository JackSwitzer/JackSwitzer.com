# Chrono - Linguistic Pattern Forecasting

Chrono is a forecasting system designed to predict linguistic patterns into the future, built during QHacks 2025. The project explores how language evolves over time using machine learning techniques.

## Project Architecture

The system is organized into five main components:

- **Polly**: Handles text-to-speech and voice synthesis
- **Data Preprocessing**: Manages data preparation workflows
- **Data Pipeline**: Orchestrates data flow through the system
- **Forecast**: Contains prediction and forecasting models
- **Server**: Backend infrastructure for deployment

## Technical Implementation

### Machine Learning Pipeline
Built an end-to-end ML pipeline that processes linguistic data, trains forecasting models, and generates predictions about language evolution patterns.

### Voice Synthesis Integration
Integrated AWS Polly for voice synthesis capabilities, allowing the system to vocalize predicted linguistic patterns.

## Team & Development

- Led a team of 4 contributors
- 52 commits over a 36-hour hackathon
- Primary language: Python (89.9% of codebase)
- Web interface built with HTML/CSS

## Hackathon Context

Built at QHacks 2025, Queen's University's annual hackathon, demonstrating rapid prototyping and team collaboration skills under time pressure.
