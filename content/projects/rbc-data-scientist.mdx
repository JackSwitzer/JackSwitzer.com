# Data Scientist at Royal Bank of Canada

During my 2024 internship at RBC, I worked as a Data Scientist focusing on time series forecasting and team technical leadership.

## Key Achievements

### Advanced Forecasting Models
Implemented time series forecasting models using:
- **Meta's Prophet**: For robust trend and seasonality detection
- **LSTM Neural Networks**: For capturing complex temporal patterns

These models achieved a **50% reduction in forecasting error** compared to existing methods, significantly improving business planning accuracy.

### Technical Leadership
Led a unit of 3 team members during a 3-week sprint focused on:
- Refactoring the existing codebase for maintainability
- Implementing standard coding practices
- Migrating version control to GitHub
- Establishing code review processes

### Business Integration
Built an Excel visualization tool that allowed non-technical team members to:
- Dynamically interact with forecast results
- Explore different scenarios
- Bridge the gap between technical analysis and business decision-making

## Impact

This role demonstrated my ability to:
- Deliver technical solutions that create measurable business value
- Lead small teams through focused technical initiatives
- Communicate complex technical concepts to business stakeholders
- Improve upon existing systems significantly
