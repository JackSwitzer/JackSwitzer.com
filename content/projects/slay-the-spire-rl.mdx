# StSRLSolver

An RL agent for Slay the Spire with an ambitious goal: beat every single seed at the highest difficulty (Ascension 20). Top human players achieve ~90% win rates, but no unlosable seeds have been proven - the question is whether ML can find a path to 100%.

## Thesis

The game has no proven unlosable seeds. If a model can learn to always win, it either proves perfect play exists or the model found strategies humans haven't discovered.

## Technical Approach

### Strategic Features
Engineering high-level strategic features rather than raw card data:
- Kill probability calculations per enemy
- Stance-specific mechanics (Wrath doubles damage)
- Block efficiency and damage predictions

### Learning Architecture
- Behavioral cloning on official game run data
- Neural network for decision evaluation
- Modular system for training and inference

## Status

Currently paused - will resume when time permits.
