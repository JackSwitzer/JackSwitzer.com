# StSRLSolver

StSRLSolver is an artificial intelligence agent designed to achieve exceptional performance in the roguelike deck-building game Slay the Spire, specifically targeting greater than 96% win rate on the Watcher character at Ascension 20 (the highest difficulty level).

## Technical Approach

### Strategic Decision-Making
The agent pre-computes 44 high-level strategic features rather than using raw card data. This includes:
- Kill probability calculations per enemy and for lethal lines
- Stance-specific mechanics (Wrath doubles damage)
- Block efficiency and incoming damage predictions

### Learning Architecture
- **Line Evaluation Module**: Simulates card play sequences
- **Combat Calculator**: Handles pre-computation of battle math
- **Enemy Database**: Maintains difficulty assessments
- **Neural Network**: Implements behavioral cloning approach

### Training Methodology
- Self-play training loop for continuous improvement
- Behavioral cloning using 77 million official game runs (2018-2020 dataset)
- Modular system supporting both active agent mode and training mode

## Current Status

This project is actively in development, with the goal of achieving a 96%+ win rate - an exceptionally high performance metric for this difficulty tier that requires sophisticated strategy implementation beyond basic heuristics.
