# Sol - Smart Bulb CLI

"Let there be Light" - Sol is a command-line tool for managing Kana smart bulbs, specifically designed for creating natural wake-up routines.

## Purpose

Waking up to harsh alarm sounds or sudden bright lights is jarring. Sol creates a gradual sunrise simulation that naturally eases you awake by slowly increasing light intensity and warmth over time.

## Features

### Sunrise Simulation
- Gradual brightness increase mimicking natural sunrise
- Color temperature shifts from warm to daylight
- Customizable timing and intensity curves

### CLI Interface
Simple command-line controls for:
- Setting wake-up schedules
- Adjusting light parameters
- Testing and previewing routines

## Technical Details

Built in Python with direct integration to Kana smart bulb APIs:
- Local network communication
- No cloud dependency
- Lightweight and fast

## Why "Sol"?

"Sol" means sun in Latin and several Romance languages - fitting for a tool that brings artificial sunrise into your bedroom.
