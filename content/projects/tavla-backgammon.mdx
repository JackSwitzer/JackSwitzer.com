# Tavla - Backgammon RL

Tavla is a reinforcement learning-based Backgammon solver designed for mobile use - helping improve your game against skilled opponents.

## Motivation

Backgammon combines skill and luck in a way that makes optimal play non-trivial. This project aims to build an AI assistant that can analyze positions and suggest optimal moves in real-time.

## Technical Approach

### Reinforcement Learning
Using RL techniques to learn optimal play:
- Self-play training for strategy development
- Position evaluation networks
- Move probability distributions

### Mobile-First Design
Designed for on-the-go use:
- Quick position input
- Fast inference for real-time suggestions
- Lightweight model for mobile deployment

## Current Status

Work in progress - actively developing the core RL training pipeline and position evaluation system.

## Future Goals

- Achieve expert-level play
- Mobile app deployment
- Position analysis explanations
